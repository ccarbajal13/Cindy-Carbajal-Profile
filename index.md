Hello there! Welcome to my professional profile that highlights valuable information related to my academic and professional development. My name is Cindy Carbajal and I a public health major at Northern Illinois University. More specifically, I am a public health major on the pre-med track. 

I am originally a transfer student from McHenry County College, where I earned an Associate of Science degree. Currenlty, I am a senior at NIU, entering my last semester before I graduate. How exciting! 

### Background

Originally, I am from a very small town located close to the Illinois-Wisconsin border. One fun fact that always surprises people, is that my high school graduating class was only composed of 16 students! After my high school graduation, I decided to stay close to home and attend community college while also learning to manage obtaining higher education. Being a first-generation student, there were and continue to be obstacles that present themselves in front of my path. However, I do my best to overcome and conquer them. Now, as a senior at NIU, I am beginning my next step in my academic career, which is studying for the MCAT and applying to medical school.
