# Blog Post 2- GitHub and Markdown

## What I learned about Markdown and Git, and how they help me contribute to open source and improve professionally?

Since first starting to learn about Markdown and Git, I feel as though I have truly expanded my knowledge in a way that better comprehends what each one does and how they relate to one another. While I am still trying to improve my skills and understanding regarding how it all works, I am much more aware of this new world of collaboration and technology. I hope to achieve a level of skill that allows me to feel comfortable when working with such tools and technology. Through these new skills I will be able to develop in a professional way that demonstrates I am open to learning new things and can collaborate in an efficient way with those around me. 

### Markdown:

- Markdown to me is comparable to a language that can be utilized to format text. 
- It is meant to be easier to learn than what typical coding is thought to be.
- Markdown allows for content to be created in a way that is easy to understand for projects like blogs, collaborative projects, notes, etc. 
- It is a universal tool that anyone can engage with and learn. 
  - With markdown I can format certain text to be **bold**.
  - I can also format it to be *italic*. 
  - Or, some **_kind of combination_** of the two can be utilized.


### Git:

- Git is a **powerful version control system** that allows for varying levels of tracking to take place for one’s project.
- It is extremely useful as it allows for modifications to be followed in a detailed manner that describes what was done, when, and by who. 
- Git also allows for branching and merging to take place in a single project. This aids in maintaining a main branch with approved changes, while also having spaces for potential alterations that can be merged later on.
- Through this system, individuals have greater access to collaboration in a way that fosters community and connections. 
- With Git, a project can also be readily distributed in a way that maintains its contents and still allows for others to make alterations.

##  Have you used them before?

Personally, I have never used Markdown or Git prior to starting this seminar. I had never even heard of either one, so I was a bit nervous to start using them. Through Markdown and Git, it is like an entire new world has been unveiled to me. I would not consider myself the most tech savvy, or say that I have considered this kind of content to be one of my interests. However, as I further engage with Markdown, [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and Github, I can see why they draw so many individuals and collaborators in. I have three main goals that I hope to accomplish as I continue to use these technologies. 

1. Reach a level of understanding that allows me to feel comfortable using these kinds of materials.
2. Become more fluent in the use of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)  so that I can easily use it without having to extensively think about what command to use.
3. Improve my skills when it comes to navigating around [GitHub](https://github.com/)  and all the tools it has to offer.

## What surprised you about Markdown or Git?

After learning more about Markdown and Git, the thing that surprised me the most about each one is how **_universal_** they both are. Both Markdown and Git allow for extensive collaboration to take place between individuals who may not even know each other face-to-face. It was shocking to me when I finally understood all the ways in which they center around promoting teamwork. 

I was also surprised to see how the formatting syntax established by Markdown can alter normal text to appear formatted, as if it were in a Word document. I didn’t realize that there were distinct ways in which text could be written to produce a format that is easy to read and appealing to look at. As a student, I’ve only ever utilized **Word** or **Google Docs** to create a document containing text. Overall, I’m excited to continue discovering all of what Markdown and Git have to offer.

  # Blog Post 3: Exploring a Repository 

## Selected Repository: _Readest_ 

### How I Selected the Repository: 

When looking for a project to select for this assignment, I was a bit nervous about being able to find one that fit my interests. I didn't realize just how many projects exist through _Github_ and how interesting they all are in their own way. Before searching for a repository, I thought about what my interests are and what type of project would best align with them. Some examples of these interests include...

- Reading 
- Online/mobile games
- Interactive media 

Personally, I feel lucky to have stumbled across the project known as _**Readest**_. It is described as being an open-source ebook reader that allows for immersive reading experiences. Along with this, it offers a variety of features that readers are able to access through different platforms. This is all in efforts to create a truly exceptional reading experience. Some of the tools and features _**Readest**_ offers are listed below. 

- **Translation services**
- **Text-to-Speech support** 
- **AI-Powered summarization**
- **Handwriting annotations**
- **Audiobook support**
- **Library Management**
- **and more!** 

### Structure: 

When I first discovered **_Readest_,** it was a bit overwhelming trying to navigate through it. This is likely due to it being the first time I've ever really been exposed to and explored a far more developed project. I'm not exactly sure why, but I thought that it would have had far more branches than it does. There is currently only one branch that is open; _the main branch_. It's interesting to see how significantly developed the project is. Based on its structure, it does appear that the project is being continuously updated and improved though.

 From looking at the repository's issues, it seems a large portion of them are attempting to address and fix bug issues. Along with that, they are also focused on adding or improving features that would be beneficial to readers who enjoy and use the project. Overall, I found the structure to be more clear after a little while. Everything also seems to be clearly labeled, allowing for collaboration to be seamless. 

### Community: 

The community on **_Readest_** appears to be one that has the best interest of the project in mind. It appears to me that everyone is willing to help one another. Within the discussion section, people will often communicate with one another fairly quickly in order to address any questions or concerns. Again, it appears that those working on this project are very engaged and dedicated to its success. This kind of collaboration is nice to see. Prior to learning about Github, I didn't know teamwork could be this accessible, even if individuals are in two different regions of the world. 

### Contribution Process: 

When opening **_Readest_**, there is a pop-up message that appeared at the top of my screen regarding contributions. The text states that if one wants to contribute to the project, there are contributing guidelines that can help an individual to do so. Ensuring that everyone is on the same page when it comes to contributions is extremely important to the integrity and safety of a project. By reading the guidelines, one can steer away from potentially causing an issue. 

From what I can tell, it appears as though there are a number of contributions going on through the issues tab. There are a total of 88 issues, with most of them being labeled as an enhancement to the project. Overall, I believe I would have to develop my skills a lot more in order to be able to make a contribution to **_Readest_**. It seems to be a bit too advanced for my current skillset, but I did have a fun time delving into its contents and learning what it is all about! It seems like a great project with a lot to offer to its users. I'm even interested in implementing it into my reading habits!
